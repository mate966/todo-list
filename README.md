# Todo App

This is my version of popular daily tasks app. It's very popular app these days but built it helped me to better understood of libriaries I used. The core of this project is React library. To create visual side of an app I decided to used Styled-Components. Also I used React Beautiful DnD for better task management. All tasks are keep in Local Storage.
